# Climbark

A [mobile web app](http://www.climbark.com) designed for rock climbers to browse and search for routes, log their climbs, and share tips on routes with ease.

Created as a 2-week final project during the Le Wagon Montr√©al Bootcamp in Nov-Dec 2022.

*Note: The nearest areas feature is a work in progress. Areas displayed on the home page are defaults. Climbark does not currently access your location.*

## Features

- Climb log that can be updated easily
- Information on routes, including photo if available
- Routes lookup by name, type or grade
- Route suggestions based on user's highest grade climbed
- Tip sharing with other users
- Map displaying area locations
