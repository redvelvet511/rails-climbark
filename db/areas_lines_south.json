P2 (5.9) Up and left from the belay is a finger crack that continues for 2-3 body lengths.  Have your nuts and small cams ready and fire away!  Once the crack is below you, start traversing left and slightly up, passing a piton or two and an awkwardly placed bolt.  You are aiming for a small tree in a left angling overhang.  Above the tree is a small ledge with a nest of old rusty pitons...and two brand new 1/2\" bolts.  Belay here.  P3 (5.?) Climb up then left, or left then up, or diagonally past a bulge 2 meters above the belay.  Continue up varied climbing for 10 meters to gain a large ledge.  From here I'm not sure where the route is supposed to go; I'll describe how we finished.  Scramble left over a large tree, then up until just below a small overhang.  Pulling the roof and you're done.  There are a few large bolts on the ground 7 meters from the cliff edge for a belay.",

Bolt #5 is run out but it is just before pulling the crux of the climb. You then come around under the roof onto an awkward block. Come out into the upper corner, clip above the roof, then easy slabby climbing to the top (7th bolt halfway up). The bolting is spread out on this route. Fun climbing, but eases up severely after coming out from under and around the roof. Expect big falls on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th clips... Missing the 3rd may result in a ground fall. You shouldn't be concerned about the 6th or 7th clip as you've already pulled the crux at this point. The slabby climbing on the upper section is very gentle. ",

Start atop a boulder and make your way left with an interesting sequence below a roof.  Pull the small roof at it's left side to easier climbing up a quartzy dihedral.  A mantle move and a few bolts later, you'll find yourself below a larger roof.  Continue up through the roof, and establish yourself on the face above (crux).  The hard climbing is over, so gun it for the chains before the pump clock runs out!!  If you blow it here, you'll be going for a ride!",
