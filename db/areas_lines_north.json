There's some decent feet outside the crack as well to find a comfy position to place pro. Bolted anchor on the ledge above.Pitch 2 (5.6 18m) More of scrambling climb, with a few variations on how you climb it. Felt a little tougher going to the left, but trending right felt like 5.6. Easy gear placements.Pitch 3 (5.8 25m) A somewhat intimidating right facing roof section with a beautiful series of cracks running up it. There are great locations for gear throughout and tons of options for feet. It gets kind wide near the top, and sometimes there's a loose stone or two. Exit teh widening crack with root running into it and use the bolts on the face to the left for a belay.Descent: Probably easiest to walk back down using the scramble (with a rope to protect it).

Worth the adventure to say you've topped out, and the section immediately above the belay station was fun, but it's not nearly the classic of pitch 1. Place some pro then commit to moving out right and up above the belay. Continue on the adventure, following the crack. Plug in some gear and walk up the slab to a large ledge. Be very careful from here, the rock quality is very suspect and crumbly. Carefully get up over the next little wall and belay off the bolts to your right, or use the giant tree/limb in front of you. Descent: Walk off the top to the 3rd class scramble protected by a rope, or follow the main hiking trail right and back to the parking area.
